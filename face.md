write a beautiful web page.

top of the screen is a map.
below that is SVG1.
below that is SVG2.

the map should load with an initial view of new mexico.
SVG1 should be rendered with data from the db, just like the current page http://localhost:3000/index_original.html but without anything else (just draw the SVG and the map).
SVG1 should be populated with 1/10 of the data (making a low res version)
