FACE.html.md

this is how face.html should work:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
the map should load with an initial view of new mexico.
SVG1 should be rendered with data from the db, just like the current page http://localhost:3000/index_original.html but without anything else (just draw the SVG and the map).
SVG1 should be populated with 1/10 of the data (making a low res version)
