# Lock Synchronization Changes

## Overview
This document tracks changes made to the lock synchronization mechanism between the PC and Raspberry Pi workers.

## Changes Made (2024-03-19)

### 1. Lock File Synchronization
- Improved directory creation handling for both PC and Pi
- Fixed SCP command issues with wildcards
- Added better error handling and logging
- Implemented individual file copying instead of wildcard copying

### 2. Database Schema
- Created SQL/001_initial_schema.sql to track database schema
- Added proper indexes for performance
- Implemented proper table structure for elevation points and progress tracking
- Added grid_size, current_i, and current_j columns to collection_progress table
- Updated schema in both code and SQL/001_initial_schema.sql
- Ensures proper tracking of grid-based collection progress

### 3. Code Structure
- Updated to use ES modules instead of CommonJS
- Improved error handling in main processing loop
- Added proper database connection management
- Implemented proper cleanup in finally blocks

## Known Issues
- Some databases show completion percentages over 100% (investigation needed)
- Lock file synchronization may still fail if SSH connection is unstable
- Rate limiting from elevation APIs (HTTP 429 errors)

## Next Steps
1. Monitor lock synchronization for stability
2. Investigate completion percentage calculation
3. Add more robust error recovery mechanisms
4. Implement proper logging rotation
5. Add retry logic for API rate limits
