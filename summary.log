# Summary Log - Latest Session

## Actions Taken
1. Created SQL directory for version control
2. Created initial database schema (SQL/001.sql)
3. Verified web server functionality
4. Created comprehensive Mac instructions
5. Documented current system state

## System Improvements
- Organized SQL files for better version control
- Documented database schema
- Added detailed troubleshooting guide
- Created comprehensive Mac-specific instructions

## Efficiency Notes
User could have:
1. Used `mkdir SQL` instead of `mkdir -p SQL` since we didn't need parent directories
2. Combined server start and curl check into a single command with background process
3. Used port 3000 directly instead of trying 8020 first

## Next Steps
1. Create PC-specific instructions
2. Add more SQL migration files as needed
3. Consider adding automated tests
4. Implement database backup strategy

## Current Status
- Web server: Running on port 3000
- Database: Operational with documented schema
- Documentation: Updated and organized
- Collection system: Fully functional in both directions 

# Session Summary (2025-06-06)

## Completed Tasks
1. Set up automated data collection service on Raspberry Pi
   - Created systemd service for automatic startup
   - Configured error recovery and logging
   - Verified even distribution across data sources

2. Verified Data Collection
   - Confirmed 10,000 points collected in first grid cell
   - Validated 25% distribution across all 4 sources
   - Set up proper logging and monitoring

## Service Files Created
- nm-elevation.service
- collect_service.sh
- instructions-pi.md

## Documentation Updates
- Added Pi-specific instructions
- Documented service management commands
- Added progress monitoring queries

## Efficiency Improvements
User could have:
1. Used single SSH command instead of multiple connections:
   ```bash
   ssh raspberry@10.0.0.68 "cd projects/nm_elevation && sudo ./setup_service.sh && systemctl status nm-elevation"
   ```

2. Used SQL query for complete status instead of multiple commands:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 grid_databases/mountains_0_0.db \
   "SELECT source, COUNT(*) as count, 
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 1) as percentage 
    FROM points GROUP BY source;"
   ```

## Next Steps
1. Let Pi complete data collection across all grid cells
2. Monitor progress through collection.log
3. Check database completion status periodically 

# Session Summary (2025-06-08)

## Actions Performed
1. Fixed ReferenceError in collect_sparse_points.js
   - Moved NM_BOUNDS constant definition before its usage
   - Error was preventing data collection from starting

2. Updated DUMMIES_GUIDE.md
   - Added Mac-specific commands
   - Improved monitoring instructions
   - Enhanced troubleshooting section
   - Added best practices

3. Checked data collection status
   - Verified logs are working
   - Confirmed collection is active
   - Monitored database updates

## Efficiency Suggestions
1. Instead of typing the full commands, you could create aliases:
   ```sh
   # Add to ~/.zshrc
   alias nm-status="node check_completion.js"
   alias nm-monitor="while true; do clear; node check_completion.js; sleep 60; done"
   alias nm-logs="tail -f collection_progress.log"
   ```

2. Your original commands could have been more efficient:
   - Used: "tail -f collection_progress.log"
   - Could use: "nm-logs" (after setting up alias)
   
   - Used: "watch -n 60 node check_completion.js" (which failed)
   - Could use: "nm-monitor" (after setting up alias)

3. For future reference, when checking if collection is working:
   - Check database_status.log first (most detailed)
   - Then collection_progress.log (general progress)
   - Finally collection_errors.log (if issues found)

## Next Steps
1. Consider setting up the suggested aliases
2. Monitor collection progress periodically
3. Check completion status every few hours
4. Keep track of which databases are being actively written to

## Status
- Collection service: Active
- Last database update: 8 minutes ago
- Overall completion: 88.94%
- Complete grids: 72/100
- Active collection in grid 4,9
