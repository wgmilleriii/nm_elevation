# Summary Log - Latest Session

## Actions Taken
1. Created SQL directory for version control
2. Created initial database schema (SQL/001.sql)
3. Verified web server functionality
4. Created comprehensive Mac instructions
5. Documented current system state

## System Improvements
- Organized SQL files for better version control
- Documented database schema
- Added detailed troubleshooting guide
- Created comprehensive Mac-specific instructions

## Efficiency Notes
User could have:
1. Used `mkdir SQL` instead of `mkdir -p SQL` since we didn't need parent directories
2. Combined server start and curl check into a single command with background process
3. Used port 3000 directly instead of trying 8020 first

## Next Steps
1. Create PC-specific instructions
2. Add more SQL migration files as needed
3. Consider adding automated tests
4. Implement database backup strategy

## Current Status
- Web server: Running on port 3000
- Database: Operational with documented schema
- Documentation: Updated and organized
- Collection system: Fully functional in both directions 

# Session Summary (2025-06-06)

## Completed Tasks
1. Set up automated data collection service on Raspberry Pi
   - Created systemd service for automatic startup
   - Configured error recovery and logging
   - Verified even distribution across data sources

2. Verified Data Collection
   - Confirmed 10,000 points collected in first grid cell
   - Validated 25% distribution across all 4 sources
   - Set up proper logging and monitoring

## Service Files Created
- nm-elevation.service
- collect_service.sh
- instructions-pi.md

## Documentation Updates
- Added Pi-specific instructions
- Documented service management commands
- Added progress monitoring queries

## Efficiency Improvements
User could have:
1. Used single SSH command instead of multiple connections:
   ```bash
   ssh raspberry@10.0.0.68 "cd projects/nm_elevation && sudo ./setup_service.sh && systemctl status nm-elevation"
   ```

2. Used SQL query for complete status instead of multiple commands:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 grid_databases/mountains_0_0.db \
   "SELECT source, COUNT(*) as count, 
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 1) as percentage 
    FROM points GROUP BY source;"
   ```

## Next Steps
1. Let Pi complete data collection across all grid cells
2. Monitor progress through collection.log
3. Check database completion status periodically
